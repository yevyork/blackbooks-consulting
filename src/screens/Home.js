Our team of experts specialize in Restaurant Bookkeeping, Culinary Operations, Beverage Program Development, and Human Resources. <br/><br/>
Our focus for Finance and Bookkeeping services is to create clear and precise monthly reports for restaurant owners. These reports are vital tools for allocating cash flows, annual budgeting, and controlling operating expenses. All Finance and Bookkeeping services are primarily accomplished through cloud based reporting after initial in- house consultations with restaurant management teams. These are long term, regular structures that allow us to strategically increase income and long-term vitality of your business. <br/><br/>
Our focus for all Operations Consulting is to create concrete systems and protocols that are cost effective, creative, and long term. These systems are vital tools for achieving your restaurant’s vision in a methodical and cost effective way, and for investing in, empowering, and retaining restaurant staff. <br/><br/>
All Operations services are primarily accomplished with in-house, side-by-side consultations and trainings between restaurant management, staff, and BlackBooks Consulting team members. 
These are short to mid-term services
and delegate as much as possible to restaurant staff and management in order to phase ourselves out as quickly as possible. 
All of our services are on an “as needed” basis depending on the structure and state of your restaurant, allowing our monthly rates to fit any project or budget.</p>
